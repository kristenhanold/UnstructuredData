## Course Project Description:
We chose to collect unstructured data from various phone companies and the reviews received on their devices. We were deploying a new phone product, and we needed to examine the current market to ensure its success and survivability. Wrote code in R to collect, analyze, visualize, and interpret the data. Based on our findings, we found the key players in their regions, what they did right, and what consumers want for our business problem.
